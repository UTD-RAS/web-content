What is AUV?
-------------
Every year the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) Foundation in conjunction with the U.S. Office of Naval research (ONR) hosts a competition for groups of engineers that challenges them to develop a functioning Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The contest is designed to simulate realistic underwater operations that the AUV Subs are expected to complete. You can read more about it on the [AUVSI Foundation Website](http://www.auvsifoundation.org/competitions/robosub/overview "AUVSI").

UTD AUV History
---------------
In 2008 UTD's AUV team placed second at that year's competition. They placed ahead of many schools who had previously dominated the competition, such as the University of Florida, and MIT. Unfortunately as the members began to graduate the team slowly dissolved and disappeared.

AUV Revival
-----------
During the 2014 spring semester the project was revived by a group of Engineering and Computer Science freshman students. The group has recovered some assets from the original team and is in the process of updating hardware and creating their own control system.
